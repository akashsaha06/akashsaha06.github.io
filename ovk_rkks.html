                <p align="justify">
                    A functional regression problem is based on learning a function \(\mathcal{F}\), where \(\mathcal{F}:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}\), \(\mathcal{X}\) is an appropriate input space and \(\mathcal{Y}\) is an output space of functions. 
                    Functional regression problems (<a href="#func_reg_fig"></a>) find applications in audio-visual tasks and weather forecasting, etc. 
                    Scalar-valued kernels \(k\), such that \(k(.,.):X\times X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) have been a popular tool for machine learning tasks where elements (e.g. vectors) from the input space \(X\) are mapped to a reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) which simplifies the task of obtaining a relationship between them. 
                    Operator-valued kernels present an extension to scalar-valued kernels such that they map two elements from the input space to a bounded linear operator on the output space. 
                    An operator-valued kernel can be mathematically defined as \(K(.,.):\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{L(Y)}\).<br>

                    Operator-valued kernels have shown promise in the field of functional regression problems. 
                    Similar to scalar-valued kernels, one of the fundamental properties of operator-valued kernels is positive semi-definiteness which ensures a bijection between the positive semi-definite kernels and the associated RKHS [<a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/11-315/11-315.pdf">Kadri et al., 2016</a>]. 
                    A relaxation of the positive semi-definiteness property of scalar-valued kernels has been explored [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1015330.1015443">Ong et al., 2004</a>], where non-positive kernels have been used to map a pair of elements in the input space to an associated reproducing kernel Krein space (RKKS). 
                    A Krein space is a direct sum of two orthogonal Hilbertian subspaces with respect to a bilinear form instead of an inner product. 
                    In this work, we consider a special category of operator-valued kernels called generalized operator-valued kernels which might not be necessarily positive semi-definite. 
                    <a href="#rkhs_fig"></a> illustrates the elements of the input space being mapped into the associated RKKS corresponding to a generalized operator-valued kernel and to an associated RKHS corresponding to an operator-valued kernel.<br>
                    We derive a result (Theorem 2.4 [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/9f319422ca17b1082ea49820353f14ab-Paper.pdf">Saha & Palaniappan, 2020</a>]) which ensures that given a generalized operator-valued kernel there exists an associated RKKS where the learning problem can be formulated. 
                    Based on the result above, we can establish that for a generalized operator-valued kernel \(\breve{K}\), we obtain an associated RKKS where the learning problem can be formulated.

                    For the learning problem formulation, we consider a regularized loss stabilization problem consisting of a loss term and a bilinear form term.
                    A minimization problem is avoided owing to the possible negativity of the bilinear form in the associated RKKS \(\mathcal{K}\).
                    The loss stabilization problem essentially finds a stationary point which may not be a minimization point.<br>

                    A representer theorem (Theorem 3.1 [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/9f319422ca17b1082ea49820353f14ab-Paper.pdf">Saha & Palaniappan, 2020</a>]) for the loss stabilization problem provides a representation of the required stabilizer which can be obtained by solving a linear operator system.
                    The linear operator system involves block operator kernel matrix which encodes the relationship between input and output functions in training data. 
                    A proposed iterative operator-based minimum residual method called OpMINRES solves the linear operator system providing basis functions which can be used with the representer theorem to obtain the learned functional. 
                    In OpMINRES algorithm, we incrementally build subspaces where residual norm minimization is performed in each iteration.<br><br>

                    In the experiments, lip aperture functions were used for speech inversion where an audio clip is used to predict the corresponding lip aperture function. 
                    We use residual sum of squares error which is suited for functional regression problems in our experiments. 
                    Various combinations of input and output kernels were considered, using difference of kernels in one of them. 
                    We used OpMINRES with various combinations of input and output kernels to create generalized operator-valued kernels. 
                    An experiment was considered using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) dataset, where we intend to figure out the relation between two FA (fractional anisotropy) tract profiles for both healthy and unhealthy individuals. 
                    The results obtained in each of the experiments were competitive with the benchmark methods. 
                    Other ways to create generalized operator-valued kernel and using them for specific functional regression problems is a possible future research area.
